## COrTADo

### Abstract

Topologically associated domains (TADs) are highly compacted regions of DNA that are suggested to be involved in proper gene regulation and cellular functioning. TADs maintain long-range interactions between distal enhancers and target genes, as well as restrict enhancers contacting genes that are not their target and, consequently, block their over-expression. In Hi-C contact maps, TADs are represented in a form of squares which are continuously spread along the diagonal. The majority of existing TAD calling tools like HiCExplorer restricts TAD borders to be allocated in a “head-to-tail” manner that do not allow complex chromatin structures. We propose the R-based TAD calling tool that detects nested and partially overlapping TADs that also allows large gaps between TADs. Using the ratio between the average upstream and downstream Hi-C interaction frequencies, our method detects where the difference between inside-TAD and outside-TAD area within the Hi-C matrix is most significant. The novel TAD allocation combined with various genomics data including binding of architectural proteins, histone modifications distribution and transcription reveals features of the maintenance and formation mechanism of 3D chromatin architecture.
